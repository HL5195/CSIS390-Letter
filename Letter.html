        <p>
            Our art program offers a diverse range of courses, focusing on both traditional

        <h2>Artistic Inspirations</h2>

        <p>
            It's great to hear about your interest in the historical influences on modern
            art. Here are some of my favorite movements and their impact:
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Impressionism</dt>
            <dd>
                Characterized by small, thin brush strokes and emphasis on accurate depiction
                of light. It has profoundly influenced the approach to outdoor painting.
            </dd>

            <dt>Abstract Expressionism</dt>
            <dd>
                This movement has led to the exploration of non-representational forms and had
                a significant impact on contemporary art's freedom of expression.
            </dd>

            <dt>Pop Art</dt>
            <dd>
                A pivotal movement that blurred the boundaries between 'high' art and popular
                culture, leading to innovative use of imagery from mass culture.
            </dd>
        </dl>
